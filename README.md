# Analysis-and-Visualisation-of-US-electricity-generation
Analysing specifically the yearly energy generated through wind in the US
Data was spooled from https://www.eia.gov/ which contains the US Energy information and administration
The analysis was done using the Numpy and Matplotlib 
The data was saved as a .csv file

The focus was on the wind energy generation hence this was extracted from the whole data array

Then data cleaning was carried out and some un-needed rows/columns removed.

The cleaned data was saved

Then the cleaned data was then visualised using the Matplot

This visualisation shows that more wind energy was generated over the years.
